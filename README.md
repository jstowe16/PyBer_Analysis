# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
To provide stakeholders information for decision-makings, the PyBer rideshare data have been used to summarize the performance of the service based on city type (Urban, Suburban and Rural). The analysis performed was focused on summarizing the ride numbers, driver numbers, total fares and average fares.

## Results
### Summary Table
A summary table for the complete dataset is provided below. This table shows the difference between the city type:
- Rural total rides are less than 
- Rural average fare per ride is greater than both Suburban and Urban city types.
- Similarly, the average fare per driver is greater for Rural drivers.
- Urban total rides, drivers and total fares are greater than Suburban and Rural.
- The total number of Urban drivers exceeds the total rides; meaning, there are more drivers than there is demand for drivers. 

Overall, the summary table illustrates that Rural drivers have a higher average fare, but the volume of Urban rides, even at lower average fare per ride, results in greater total fares in comparison.
