# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
To provide stakeholders information for decision-makings, the PyBer rideshare data have been used to summarize the performance of the service based on city type (Urban, Suburban and Rural). The analysis performed was focused on summarizing the ride numbers, driver numbers, total fares and average fares.

## Results
### Summary Table
A summary table for the complete dataset is provided below. This table shows the difference between the city type:
- Rural total rides are less than than both Surburban and Urban.
- Rural average fare per ride is greater than both Suburban and Urban.
- Similarly, the average fare per driver is greater for Rural drivers.
- Urban total rides, drivers and total fares are greater than Suburban and Rural.
- The total number of Urban drivers exceeds the total rides; meaning, there are more drivers than there is demand for drivers. 

Overall, the summary table illustrates that Rural drivers have a higher average fare, but the volume of Urban rides, even at lower average fare per ride, results in greater total fares in comparison.

### Total Fares By City Type: January 1, 2019 to April 29, 2019
The total weekly fares by city type between the subject dates are provided in the figure below. The plot supports the above tabular results: the Urban tota fares exceedd both Suburban and Rural in this timeframe.

## Summary
Based on the analysis summarized above, the following are recommended:
+ As the number of Urban drivers exceeds the demand, reassess the total number of drivers necessary or ways to increase the demand.
+ To maximize the balance of average fare per ride and per driver, focusing marketing efforts in Suburban city types may increase total revenue. 
+ Investigate what potential there is to increase Rural ride demand to capitalize on the higher average fare per ride (presumably due to longer average distance traveled). One concept could be conducting town halls in the key Rural cities to promote the service, its benefits and offerings.
+ Related, investigate whether there is any correlation to the Rural total rides and availability of high-speed internet/cell service to allow for easier app usage.
